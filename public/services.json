    "details": "Bali Island is located in Indonesia. It is only 2 kilometers from Java and lies 8 to 9 degrees south of the equator. The island of Bali is popular among tourists from all over the world. Bali is quite different from the rest of Indonesia and is a province. It has its own government, but the Jakarta-based government controls the economy to a high degree. The island's Balinese culture is a major attraction for tourists. This culture, passed through the region, was influenced by many cultures, especially those of Europe, China and India.A notable attraction is that the island has also shown innovative capacity in influencing its tourists, but technological progress in Bali has been slow. Although hotels, restaurants and other public places are of high quality, fast and reliable connectivity cannot be promised in these areas. Despite this fact, the island of Bali is actually very popular in terms of tourism and especially honeymoons. Many honeymooners and romantic couples love this area for their vacation.",

      "Tanah Lot-Numerous temples in Bali. However, Tanah Lot Temple is prominent among them. The temple is said to have been built in 1600 AD at Tanah Lot to protect it from volcanic eruptions. The temple is built on a huge rock in the sea. At high tide, much of the temple goes under water, making it appear as if it had risen from the sea. The temple along with the foundation is visible during low tide. There is an entrance fee to enter the temple. It was late afternoon when I reached Tanah Lot Temple, 28 km from Ubud. I went to that temple after crossing the sea water. The sunset from there is an incredibly beautiful view.",
